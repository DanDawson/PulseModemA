        <p>PulseModem A can work without Internet, by connecting the audio port to your amateur radio.</p>
        
        <!-- <p>There are several ways to connect </p> -->

<h4>How to connect to your radio</h4>

<p>If you are using the commonly available Baofeng UV-5R, you may buy the APRS-K2 cable.</p>

<p>You may also build an adaptor yourself, such as this BaofengUV5R-TRRS:<br />
  https://github.com/johnboiles/BaofengUV5R-TRRS</p>

  <p>There are also the "Easy Digi" interfaces available on ebay as well.</p>

  <p>If you only need to transmit your APRS message, you may actually use the headset output hole, to pipe the audio into your radio mic. This is not recommended though.</p>

<p>You may need to set your radio in VOX mode, for automatic PTT triggers.</p>


<h4>Getting Optimal Audio Input ⚠️</h4>

<p>If the RF Audio input is either too low, or too high, then PulseModem A may not decode the APRS signals efficiently.</p>

<p>Please:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Observe the wave form at the "RF Receive". Make sure it has a nice wave.</li>
    <li>Fiddle with your radio and your iPhone volumes. You may need to experiment a bit.</li>
</ol>

<p>Future versions of PulseModem A will have better AGC to assist. But there are so much an AGC can do.</p>

  <h4>How to transmit the message in the app</h4>

  <p>Go to the "Transmit" section, make sure your callsign SSID has been setup.</p>

  <p>Just type a message, and click "Send ARPS Message". An AX.25 encoded AFSK audio will be generated, which can be transmitted in VOX mode with your radio.</p>

<p>Future versions of the PulseModem A is expected to have a BLE triggered PTT interface with your radio, so stay tuned.</p>
